The Left Hand is a Resident Evil style action/horror game that was done as a solo game jam project. 

You are a paranormal investigator sent to check out a mansion owned by a nefarious cult, The Left Hand of God. Upon entering, you find a dead body on the ground and hear the door lock behind you. 
The place is filled with zombies and you must dodge, shoot, and solve your way out. There is a limited amount ammunition and healing items placed throughout the house, so you'll need to use them sparingly.

Multiple elements of the house have various puzzles to solve. Some puzzles can be completed with only what is availible to you (though, notes and other information could provide useful hints), while others 
will require items to be collected in other rooms.

The game uses a top-down isometric view, with simple controls:
- WASD movement
- Mouse click for shooting and interacting
- R to reload

Walking over ammo and health items automatically consumes them.
